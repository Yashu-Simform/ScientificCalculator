# ScientificCalculator
-   I have tried to implement this calc with the specified operations without using any direct or default functions like eval.
-   I have used the postfix evaluation method using stack to evaluate the expressions given by user. 

### Operations
This Calc enables you to do the basic operations like: +, -, *, /, 1/x, x^2, modulo (%)


### Memory
-   It also has support for memory where you can save the result and then do operations like add and substract.
-   You can store into mempory using MS
-   You can read from memory using MR
-   You can clear memory using MC

### Edge Cases
-   Preserves Precedency and associativity of the operators
-   Validation of correct operands and operator pairs.
